                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    As shown in See User Interface, VelocityDRIVE CT can monitor connected switches in the See Devices Tab and build YANG catalog changes in the See Configurations Tab.
                    It is best to think of the See Devices Tab (and the explorable YANG libraries) as being the active state of a switch. 
                    The See Configurations Tab should be viewed as a staging area for planned switch changes.
                    Using both tab functions in tandem will allow a user to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>See the switch's current state in action</li>
                    <li>Copy the active Device state parameters to a Configuration and make changes</li>
                    <li>Upload the new Configuration to the Device</li>
                    <li>Confirm if those changes take affect on the Device(s) in real time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In this chapter we will outline the different levels of Configurations a user can create, 
                    the various methods used in creating Configurations, and how Configurations are applied to a device.

                <h2>Configuration Types</h2>
                <p>
                    There are two main configuration types that a user can create. This first is a See Full Datastore Configuration based on a Device's entire YANG Catalog. 
                    The second is a See Patch Datastore Configuration, which applies changes to only a subset of the YANG Catalog structure.
                    If this is your first time interacting with the VelocityDRIVE ™ Configuration Tool User's Guide, 
                    we recommend using the following steps first to create a Full Datastore Configuration to fully understand the operating principles of VelocityDRIVE CT.

                    <h3>Full Datastore Configurations</h3>
                    <p>
                        The simplest way to change the default values of a device’s running datastore is to
                        retrieve the switch’s entire YANG instance for editing in a Full Datastore Configuration.
                        VelocityDRIVE CT configurations are stored offline and do not become active on
                        the switch until temporarily synced or uploaded and saved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Note: 
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            Once the device’s default configuration is retrieved by VelocityDRIVE CT, it
                            recommended to export and save it as a reference. See Chapter 7. “Default
                            Configuration Backup Advisory” for more details.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the device's default Configuration is copied by VelocityDRIVE CT, we recommend that it is exported saved as a reference. 
                        See See Default Configuration Backup Advisory for more details.

                        <h4>Device Selection</h4>

                        <p>
                            First, confirm that the target device is available and seen in the Devices tab. See
                            Section 3.7 “Devices Tab” for more information on connecting a Device.                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you have verified your device selection, follow the steps in
                            Section 3.7.1.2 “Exploring the YANG Catalog from the Devices tab” to enter the interface.                            
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Begin in the /(root) of your device's YANG Catalog datastore in the Devices tab.                            
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter-subdivision">
                        <h4>Copying Full Datastore</h4>

                        <p>
                            In the Configurations dashboard highlighted in Figure 4-1, identify the Configuration
                            named “Default” (see Section 4.3.3 “Naming VelocityDRIVE CT Configurations” for
                            updating Configuration names). While still in the /(root) of your device, click the Copy
                            Datastore button . This copies your Device's entire YANG Catalog datastore into
                            the associated Configuration file.
                            <strong>Note</strong>
                            <p>
                                The exact values seen between the running datastore in the Devices tab
                                and those captured in the datastore seen in the Configurations tab may
                                vary. There are two reasons for these variations. First, only configurable values
                                are requested to be shown in the Configurations tab. Second, because
                                VelocityDRIVE CT performs the datastore retrievals for a device and a configuration
                                as two separate actions, other transactions occurring in the running
                                datastore (such as those performed by other users) may have made
                                changes to the values.
                                Next, click the Open Configuration
                            </p>
                            Next, click the Open Configuration button. This opens the root folder of the Configuration.
                            The “Default” Configuration is now ready to be named and worked with. See
                            Section 4.4 “Configuration Editing” for working with the tool.                            
                        </p>

                    <h3>Patch Datastore Configuration</h3>
    
                    <p>
                        For instances when only a particular segment of a switch's YANG Catalog will be modified,
                        a Patch configuration can be created. Patch Datastore Configurations are smaller
                        in file size and easier to navigate, as they only contain the segment of the YANG Catalog
                        tree that is being changed. To create a Patch, we will create a new configuration
                        in the Configurations tab.                        
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            After creating any new configuration, we recommend giving the configuration a unique name, as described in See Naming VelocityDRIVE CT Configurations. 
                            For this example, we will use the name “Patch”.

                        <p>
                            Create a full datastore configuration (as described in Section 4.3.1 “Full Datastore
                            Configuration”). Then, selectively remove all unneeded branches (see
                            Section 4.4 “Configuration Editing” for instructions on removing branches). Any
                            changes made to the remaining branches is considered a patch.                            
                        </p>

                        <h5>Alternate Method 2</h5>
                        <p>
                            Export a full datastore of your YANG Catalog from the /(root) of the Configuration tab
                            using the Export button , saving it as a *.JSON file. Using a text editor, remove all
                            unnecessary branches and make modifications to the isolated branch area. Then using
                            the Import button , upload the Patch (setting upload type to “Patch,” not “Replacement”)
                            to the appropriate branch segment of your existing Configuration. For more
                            information on importing and exporting, please see Section 4.8 “Export And Import of
                            Device Library and Configurations”.

                            Note: Importing a Patch to a Configuration at the incorrect branch/node level will
                            result in an error.

                    In VelocityDRIVE CT, navigating through an active device’s YANG tree structure is a
                    read-only experience. But when exploring a datastore retrieved from a device for use
                    in a configuration, the majority of leaf values and variables are now editable.

                        In the example in Figure 4-11, we see that max-bundle currently has a value of 0. We
                        can change that value to a different integer. The value above it, failover-mode, also
                        has an editable value, allowing you to toggle between revertive and non-revertive.
                        Changing the values to “‘1” and “non-revertive,” we have now altered our Configuration.
                        Before we upload these alterations as a permanent change, we may wish to test them
                        on the switch temporarily using the Apply Configuration button (see
                        Section 4.5 “Applying a Configuration”).

                <p>
                    Navigating to the same path address in the target Device will show that the values have
                    been updated to match the new values in the Configuration, as shown in Figure 4-13.

                    The benefit of using the Apply Configuration button is that it empowers the user
                    to observe how different values affect a device in real time. Values can be tweaked and
                    applied until the desired result is achieved.

                    Note: If the values are not what you expect them to be (after either using the Apply
                    Configuration button or after a reset/power cycle), use the Refresh button
                    while in the Device tab to send a FETCH command to the device (see

                    To permanently apply changes to a device, a Full Datastore (root level) or Patch
                    (branch level) Configuration will need to be uploaded (see Section 4.6 “Configuration

                <p>
                    If a Configuration is not behaving as expected, you may want to troubleshoot the
                    design by seeing how the device behaves with particular containers no longer present.
                    Yet removing and then reincorporating branches (and their values) one by one can be
                    a tedious process (and may introduce errors). This is when the Delete Toggle
                    feature is extremely useful.

                <p>
                    Located in top left of the user interface main panel in certain types of elements is the
                    Delete Toggle button. Sliding it into the “on” position effectively deactivates or “mutes”
                    the element (and all nodes and leafs nested under it) from the Configuration during the
                    next upload or sync process.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: With this toggle activated, the tool will perform the next upload to the device
                    as an iPatch command, replacing the container with a null instance identifier.

                    suppressed (notice the presence of the red stop icon now adjacent to the container).
                    The container can be reinstated to the Configuration by deactivating the Delete

                    allowing for backup and restoration of data outside of the VelocityDRIVE CT Project
                    file format                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    Exports of both Device libraries and user created Configurations are saved in various
                    text-based formats. This provides the added benefit of allowing users to edit exports in
                    the text-based coding program of their choice. Exported files can also be diffed for
                    debug comparison purposes. We advise users to make a backup of their Device’s original
                    library as a regular best practice. Please see Chapter 7. “Default Configuration
                    Backup Advisory” for more details.

                        The content of any container on the Device can be exported in various formats. This

                        YANG tree (for partial backups or patches).To export the content, click the Export button
                        (shown in Figure 4-18) and choose the file format extension. The following formats
                        are available:
