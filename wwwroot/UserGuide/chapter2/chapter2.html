                <p>
                    Before using the VelocityDRIVE CT tool to configure a switch, you may desire to update the device's
                    firmware. For the most up to date version of VelocityDRIVE SP firmware compatible with your device, 
                    follow the instructions on the SW Packets page of the VelocityDRIVE SP 
                    <a href="https://microchip-ung.github.io/velocitydrivesp-documentation/vd-docs/2025.06/doc-intro.html" target="_blank">Documentation Site.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After acquiring the firmware image (*.FIP format), conenct the switch to your PC via USB, and start
                    the VelocityDRIVE™ CT software:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Click on the <strong>Devices</strong> tab, as shown in Figure 2-4.

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    A progress bar will appear below the Upload button. Do not power down the board until
                    it has finished. Once the progress bar disappears, you can power cycle or reset the
                    board to load the new firmware and confirm that the version has changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Note:</b>
                <p>
                    If changes have been made to a switch's startup configuration (See
                    Section 4.6 “Configuration Upload”), we advise confirming that the customized
                    configuration does not conflict with the latest firmware. Please reference
                    the firmware change log. Additionally, a firmware update will not erase any
                    custom changes made to a startup configuration unless a hard reset is performed.
                    If it is found that conflicts occur between the custom startup configuration
                    and the new firmware update, the custom configuration can be
                    removed by performing a factory reset. To proceed, hold the reset button for
                    3 seconds to restore the default configuration from the firmware package

                        Now that the back-up is complete, press the Copy Datastore button at the bottom
                        of the Devices tab. This retrieves all configurable values from your device's YANG
                        instance datastore into a default configuration file.
                        Next, click the adjacent Open Configuration button. This opens the default configuration's
                        root folder.

                        As shown in Figure 2-12, navigate to the Configurations tab's Name/Description
                        sub-tab and under Configuration Name type in “CoAP Configuration” and click
                        Update.

                    <p>
                        Remaining in the Configurations tab, switch back to the Values sub-tab. Using the
                        menu on the left, navigate to the /root/coap-server/config container using the branching
                        menu tree. You will see that the security-mode (enumeration) leaf is set to raw-public-
                        key. Toggle the security-mode to no-sec.

                    <p>
                        Save the current configuration as part of the device’s startup datastore by clicking the
                        Upload button in the lower left Devices tab. If successful, you will receive a notification
                        at the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 2-14. Reboot the device by tapping
                        the reset button once (do not power cycle board, as the new startup configuration
                        will be lost).
                        Returning to the Devices tab, press the Refresh button.

                    <p>
                        Confirm the change has been made using the Explore button in the Device Card and
                        navigating to the /root/coap-server/config container. The value of the security-mode
                        leaf on the device should now be no-sec, indicating that the device is configured to use
                        CoAP over UDP without any security options.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Note: </strong>
                        <p>
                            If the value did not appear to change on the device, use the Refresh button
                            to the right of the value to send a FETCH command to obtain the current
                            value (see Section 3.7.2 “Devices Tab Interface” for more details).
                        </p>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, return to the Configurations tab and navigate to /interfaces/interface. Delete all
                        present interfaces (name=1, name=2, AGGR1, etc.).
                        Use the Add Item button . Open interface[name=’_’]. For the Value in the
                        name (string) row of the main panel, delete the dash and add L3V1.
                        In the left panel, use the Clear button to remove all children nodes if present.
                        In the YANG Elements selection sidebar menu, select ipv4 and use the Add Selected
                        button to add it as a child node. Click on ipv4 and add the address YANG
                        Element. Select it and press the Add Item button once again.
                        The empty address container should now read address: ip=0.0.0.0. Click on it to open
                        a leaf named ip (inet:ipv4-address-no-zone → string). Inside the empty IP address
                        value in the main panel, enter the IP address of your choosing to assign to the switch
                        (in accordance with your local Ethernet Network IP assignments).
                        Return to the /(root) location of your configuration and add these new parameters to the
                        startup configuration datastore by clicking the Upload button in the lower Devices
                        Dashboard.
                        Then, reboot the device by tapping the reset button once (do not power cycle board, as
                        the new startup configuration will be lost). Press the Refresh button on the Device
                        Card in the Devices tab.
                        Confirm the change by visiting the /interfaces/interface/interface[
                        name=’L3V1]’/ipv4/address location on your device. You will see that the iPatch
                        command only synced the interface you were adding, and did not make changes to the
                        other interfaces in the tree. Removing the unchanged interfaces from the same branch
                        level in your configuration ensures the patch change is isolated to only this single addition.
                        Next, using your PC’s terminal, ping the IP address you assigned to your switch. Once
                        successful, you may add the device’s network connection in the Devices tab as outlined
                        below.
