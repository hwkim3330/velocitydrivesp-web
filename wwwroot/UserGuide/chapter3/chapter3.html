                    VelocityDRIVE CT is powered by a feature rich user interface. 
                    For information on using the software's command line interface, 
                    please see <a href="">Chapter 6: “Command Line Tool Interface”.</a> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The major functions of the software's graphic user interface are organized within the top ribbon of the application in a row of tabs
                    This chapter outlines the functions and navigation of each tab.

                <h2>Devices and Configurations</h2>
                <p>
                    Before interacting with the user interface, it is important to understand the underlying
                    VelocityDRIVE CT workflow.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Changes are not made directly to a device’s YANG instances/datastores, but are
                    instead performed first in a configuration within the Configurations Tab. A configuration
                    is a set of YANG instances retrieved from the device that are allowed to be modified
                    by the user. Once retrieved, the user is free to make changes to the instances contained
                    in the configuration. These changes do not yet affect the switch directly. Once
                    the user is satisfied with their changes, the revised values in the configuration can
                    uploaded to the device temporarily by performing a sync. If successful, the tool will
                    re-read the running datastore of the device. The changed values (and affected YANG
                    instances) can then be evaluated from the Devices Tab.                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Explained in a different way, think of the YANG instances displayed in the Devices Tab
as the current state of the switch (the running datastore). The YANG instances shown
in the Configurations Tab is a possible state of the switch.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    To better understand the difference, the following sequence outlines the basic operating
                    process of VelocityDRIVE CT.                    
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The user connects a valid switch to their PC and opens the VelocityDRIVE CT software. The software will then recognize the device.</li>
                    <li>Once the device is identified, VelocityDRIVE CT downloads the device's corresponding YANG/CORECONF library.</li>
                    <li>The library is loaded into the Devices Tab, which is then populated by actual data from the connected switch. This is the current state of the switch.</li>
                    <li>
                        Once the YANG instances are retrieved, they may be edited in the Configurations
                        Tab. A configuration, which can either be a patch to specific YANG instances or
                        a whole datastore, can be thought of as a possible state of the entire switch or
                        some specific part of its configuration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changes made in a configuration will not be seen on the switch until the configuration
                        is applied to the running datastore. Whole datastore changes can be
                        saved permanently in the device’s startup memory (only seen on the device after
                        a reboot command or a push of the reset button). Patches made to the running
                        datastore are temporary. Patches can be saved permanently, but only as a part
                        of a whole datastore in the device’s startup memory.

                <p>
                    A pair of Navigation buttons  can be found in the top left corner of the VelocityDRIVE™ CT user interface ribbon. 
                    These backwards and forward navigators can be used to quickly return to previous tabs, screens, and tree structure nodes throughout the software.

                <p>
                    VelocityDRIVE CT utilizes Project files to store data from Configurations and Devices. 
                    Fillable fields within the main Project tab are available to annotate an individual Project file's relevant properties and information.

                    <p>
                        VelocityDRIVE CT provides a familiar breadcrumb style interface to navigate the YANG
                        Catalog tree. The list of YANG elements are visible in the left sidebar menu. Figure 3-6
                        outlines the layout and symbols found in the user interface.

                                The top navigation address bar displays the tree structure URI. It is interactive;
                                the address level names act as shortcuts, jumping to previous positions along the
                                traveled path. Various icons provide context to the tree positions

                                    An “arrow down symbol” indicates that there are sibling elements adjacent to
                                    that element position in the tree structure. Clicking on this button will display a list
                                    of these siblings; selecting one will jump to its location                            
                                </li>

                                    An “arrow right symbol” indicates that the node is singular and has no adjacent
                                    siblings on the path.

                                    An “open and closed bracket pair” indicates that the element is a list and contains
                                    similar elements

                                    A grid icon indicates that the node is a container, holding multiple types of
                                    containers, lists, etc

                                    The leaf list icon (not pictured) indicates that the container is actually a leaf
                                    list, holding multiple configurable values.
                                    <p>
                                        Note: In an empty leaf list, values (represented by the leaf list value icon ) may
                                        be added using the Add Item button .                                
                                    </p>

                                The left navigation panel is used for browsing between elements that are
                                located on the same tree level. Clicking on an element name opens its position
                                on the tree, revealing its data in the main panel (3). After selecting an element,
                                the left panel updates its roster to show any items nested within. At the top of the
                                panel, a bread crumb navigational button allows for traveling back up one tree
                                level. The left navigation panel is home to the following buttons:                            
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    A check box toggle for selecting children nodes for deletion (activates Delete
                                    button ). This function is covered in more detail in
                                    Section 4.4 “Configuration Editing”.                                    
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A check box toggle for selecting children nodes for deletion (activates Delete
                                    button ). This function is covered in more detail in
                                    Section 4.4 “Configuration Editing”.

                                <li>
                                    Exports the current element (and all child nodes) for text-based editing. See
                                    Section 4.8.3 “Configuration Export (YAML, JSON)” for more information                                    
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Imports the previously exported and subsequently edited element (and all
                                    children nodes at current branch). See Section 4.8.4 “Configuration Import
                                    (YAML, JSON)” for more information.                                    
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Deletes all children nodes from this element                                    
                                </li>

                                    The main panel displays YANG catalog element information. When an element
                                    is opened, three tabbed sections are shown: Values, Name/Description, and
                                    Details.
                                    Under Values you will see three column headers: Name (a property name),
                                    Value (the property’s editable value) and Actions.
                                    Under Name/Description, you will find the Configuration’s name and description
                                    (a good shortcut for note taking while editing). Naming a Configuration is covered
                                    in Section 4.3.3 “Naming VelocityDRIVE CT Configurations”.
                                    Under the Details tab, you will find a brief description of the element, the URI,
                                    the Read-Only status and SID number

                                Once the YANG instances are retrieved, they may be edited in the Configurations
                                Tab. A configuration, which can either be a patch to specific YANG instances or
                                a whole datastore, can be thought of as a possible state of the entire switch or
                                some specific part of its configuration.

                                    This icon indicates that the element is a leaf.                                    
                                </li>

                                    Clicking on the “caret right” icon reveals additional information on the leaf’s
                                    property.

                                    A key icon next to certain names acts similarly to a key in a database schema,
                                    indicating that it is a unique identifier for the containers in the list                                    
                                </li>

                                    A shield icon indicates that the leaf is mandatory                                    
                                </li>

                                    Pressing the fingerprint button copies the ID address of the instance/leaf. This
                                    is particularly helpful when using the Command Line Tool Interface.

                                    Pressing the copy button will copy the present Value assigned to the
                                    instance/leaf. This is particularly helpful when using the Command Line Tool Interface.

                                    listed on the same line in a grayed out column to the right. Also, elements
                                    colored in green are nodes that can contain values or strings that can be
                                    modified.

                            The top navigation address bar displays the tree structure URI. It is interactive;
                            the address names act as shortcuts, jumping to previous positions along the traveled
                            path. Various icons provide context to the tree positions:                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The left navigation panel is used for browsing between elements that are
                            located on the same tree level. Clicking on an element name opens its position
                            on the tree, revealing its data in the main panel (3).The left panel will update to
                            show any items nested within the selected element. At the top of the panel, a
                            bread crumb navigational button allows for traveling back up one level.

                        <li>
                            The main panel displays YANG catalog element information. When an element
                            is open, two data tabs are shown, Values and Details. Under Values, three column
                            headers (Name, Value, and Actions) are used to display a property name,
                            its corresponding value, and in some instances a Refresh button is presented
                            (see more detail in the bullet below). Under Details, you will find a brief description
                            of the element, the URI, the Read-Only status and SID number. The following
                            icons are used in interpreting the main panel:                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            : The Refresh button sends a FETCH command to the device. This function is
                            helpful for pulling changing variable information (such as statistics) from an
                            active device. The Refresh button can appear next to both container names in
                            the left navigation panel (for a full device refresh) and leaves in the main panel
                            (for a refresh of just that element).

                        <li>
                             : The Download button allows the user to export the current YANG Catalog
                            entry in a variety of formats. When the button is used at Device root, the entire
                            YANG tree is included. When used on an element, only that node and the elements
                            contained within (including all children nodes) will be exported. See
                            Section 4.8.1 “Device State Export (CBOR, JSON)” for more information.

                    A search tool is provided to aide in finding relevant variables and values.

                <p>
                    As seen in Figure 3-14, the Search tool is available in the top right of the navigation
                    ribbon. It can be used while in any other tab, and its results appear as an overlay on
                    top of the display currently in view.

                    Search results appear in a right-side panel displaying results by origin: Configurations
                    or Devices. The search results panel also includes a filter for Configurations and

                    distinguish between similarly named results. Clicking on a result will take you to the
                    page containing the item in question.
