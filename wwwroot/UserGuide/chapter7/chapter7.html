                    This chapter discusses best practices when using VelocityDRIVE CT to ensure firmware
                    usability and integrity

                        Please read and consider the following information before making changes to
                        your network design:
                    </b>
                    When changing a default value (Ex. VLAN-Port-VID), be aware that some variable
                    changes may not be supported by the switch’s firmware. If this is the case, the VelocityDRIVE
                    CT tool will generate an error (indicated at bottom of the tool’s screen) when
                    attempting to apply the unsupported change to the firmware. Navigating to the Log
                    View will show the actual error message, including communication and trace details.
                    Also be aware that some default settings should not be cleared from a Configuration.
                    For example, it would be inadvisable to clear VID 1, as it is the management VLAN that
                    is automatically applied to all ports. Be careful not to remove it, or other vital aspects.
                    To safeguard design experimentation from irreversible changes, it is highly recommended
                    to create a backup copy of your default configuration.
                    Navigate to the /(root) of your unaltered Default configuration file, and using the Export
                    button , export a full datastore of your YANG Catalog (either as *.JSON or *.BIN) and
                    save it as a backup. With this best practice in place, you can always refer to the default
                    configuration to compare the values of containers, sub-containers, and leaves that
                    were present by default as you experiment with adding and removing different settings.
