                        The VelocityDRIVE ™ Configuration Tool (VelocityDRIVE CT) is a network configuration and monitoring software with a graphical user interface (GUI)
                        designed to configure and monitor VelocityDRIVE SP-based switches. 
                        VelocityDRIVE SP is a turnkey L2 software application for Automotive Ethernet switches, 
                        built for constrained environments executing from on-chip memory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Designed for both software developers and network implementers, VelocityDRIVE CT
                        aides in the configuration and management of network switches through the customization
                        of YANG module parameters. Its interface simplifies the complexities associated
                        with YANG/CORECONF protocols, thereby enabling network developers to quickly
                        generate exportable protocol configurations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Developed as a cross-platform tool, VelocityDRIVE CT has been designed and tested
                        on Windows and the Ubuntu distribution of Linux (it can be used with other Linux distributions
                        and environments as well).

                    <h2>Introduction to the YANG Data Model</h2>
                    <p>
                        The YANG (Yet Another Next Generation) data model is a powerful and standardized data modeling language used to organize configuration and state data for information sent over network management protocols. Microchip has chosen to integrate the YANG/CORECONF standard into the VelocityDRIVE Software Platform and Configuration Tool. This decision is driven by several key advantages that YANG offers, making it an ideal choice for modern network management and configuration.
                    </p>
                    <div class="chapter-subdivision" id="why-yang">
                        <h3>Why YANG?</h3>
                        <!-- Code generated by MCHP Chatbot -->
                        <p>
                            YANG is a standardized data modeling language that is both human-readable and machine-friendly. This standardization is crucial as it ensures consistency and interoperability across different network devices.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            YANG's modularity allows for the creation of model-driven tools that can be easily extended and reused. This modular approach not only streamlines our VelocityDRIVE toolset but also enhances the flexibility and scalability of network management solutions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            YANG supports various data encoding formats such as XML, JSON, and CBOR, making it versatile in different network environments. Additionally, YANG enables atomic transactions, ensuring that all changes are applied successfully or none at all, preventing misconfigurations and maintaining network stability. YANG has been widely adopted by key standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Open Networking Foundation (ONF). Furthermore, YANG's standardized approach reduces the need for proprietary extensions, thereby enhancing interoperability.
